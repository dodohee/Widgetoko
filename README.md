# Widgetoko

A Node.js and Electron demonstration app written in C# then compiled to JavaScript using [Bridge](http://bridge.net) and [Retyped](https://retyped.com). 

Widgetoko enables users to connect to Twitter and watch tweets arrive in real-time that match a specified search term.

There are several options for installing Widgetoko. Packaged installers are available as .exe (Win) and .dmg (Mac), or you can build the project from the original source code.

## Introduction

[![Video Tutorial](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62210/31647625-8def053e-b2c6-11e7-80ad-5164f26fcbd8.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nL_WlEPHXU)

## Installers

Platform | Version | Installer
---- | ---- | ----
Win | 1.0.0 | [Widgetoko.exe](https://github.com/bridgedotnet/Archives/raw/master/Widgetoko/1.0.0/Widgetoko.exe)
Mac | 1.0.0 | [Widgetoko.dmg](https://github.com/bridgedotnet/Archives/raw/master/Widgetoko/1.0.0/Widgetoko.dmg)

## Build from source

### Requirements

1. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

### Start

1. Clone the [Widgetoko](https://github.com/bridgedotnet/Widgetoko) repo or download [source](https://github.com/bridgedotnet/Widgetoko/archive/master.zip)
1. Using the **Command** (Win) or **Terminal** (Mac), browse to the `/dist` directory
1. Run the following `yarn` command:

```
yarn install
```

If this is your first time running `yarn install` on the `/dist/` folder, **Yarn** may take a few minutes to download the required packages. Just let the process run. 

Once `yarn install` is complete, run the following `yarn start` command and an instance of the **Widgetoko** app should start automatically.

```
yarn start
```

### Compile C# source

The above steps will run the previously released JavaScript files, but it is also very easy to fully recompile the original C# source code in Visual Studio.

1. Double click the `/src/Widgetoko.sln` file to open in Visual Studio
1. Select `Build` > `Rebuild Solution` from the main Visual Studio menu
1. Run the command `yarn install` (if you have not done so earlier)

You can then start an instance of the Widgetoko app by running the command `yarn start`. 

It is also possible to start Widgetoko directly from Visual Studio by clicking the **Start** button or hitting <kbd>F5</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl + F5</kbd>, _BUT FIRST_... there are two Project Properties that need to be set (see image below).

1. Right-click on the Widgetoko Project in the Solution, and select **Properties**
2. Under the **Debug** tab, select **Start external program** and paste the value `..\dist\node_modules\electron\dist\electron.exe`
3. In the **Command line arguments** field, paste the value `../../../dist`

Now the **Start** button will work as expected and the Widgetoko app will launch.

## Configure Twitter Tokens

A connection to the Twitter Stream is required, so we must register the Widgetoko app with Twitter and generate Access Tokens. This is a required step to tap into the Tweet stream.

1. Browse to https://apps.twitter.com/app/new

1. Fill in the fields (App name, Description, WebSite). You should use your own unique Application name, and any values you want for the other fields.

1. Press **Create your Twitter application** button.

1. The application has been created. Now go to **Keys and Access Tokens** tab.

1. Press **Create My access token** button to generate keys.

1. That's it, all tokens are generated:

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62210/31524621-2bff5686-af78-11e7-82de-b7fa528280ce.png"></p>

1. The last step. You should copy-paste those tokens into Widgetoko app. Run Widgetoko, press <kbd>F2</kbd> (or **File** > **Options**) to open **Options** form, paste your tokens as shown below. Click **Save**.

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62210/31524622-2c17c1d0-af78-11e7-87ee-ef4add2af6ed.png"></p>

**Security Notice:**

Your tokens will be saved in **%appdata%/widgetoko/UserSettings.json** in an obfuscated format. You have several options to remove tokens afterwards:
- Just delete that file.
- Replace the **Options** form with empty values, then click **Save** to overwrite your old token values.
- Invalidate the tokens from the Twitter [app configuration](https://apps.twitter.com/app/), or just delete the app from Twitter.

## Build Installers

Creating an actual installer for the Widgetoko app is very simple. To create the installer, use the following steps:

1. Clone this repo (if you have not done so already)
1. With a **Command Window** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac), browse to the `/dist` directory
1. Run the following `yarn` commands:

```
yarn install
yarn build
```

Installers can be created for Mac, Windows, and Linux. The installer creation process should take no more than a few minutes, but needs to be run on each platform you support. If you want an .exe for Windows, run the command on a Windows machine. Need a Mac installer? run the command on a Mac. 

The installer files, such as .exe (Win) and .dmg (Mac), will be added to the **/dist/installers/** folder and those files can be deployed to your users.
